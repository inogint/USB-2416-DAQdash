Scanner
-------

The *Scanner* module is an object dealing with configuration of scan modes and is mainly used by the DAQ_Scan extension.
It features a graphical interface, see :numref:`scan2D_fig`, allowing the configuration of the scan type and all its
particular settings. The **Scan type** sets the type of scan, **Scan1D** for a scan as a function of only one actuator,
**Scan2D** for a scan as a function of two actuators, **Sequential** for scans as a function of 1, 2...N actuators and
**Tabular** for a list of points coordinates in any number of actuator phase space. All specific features of these scan
types are described below:

Scan1D
++++++

The possible settings are visible on :numref:`scan1D_fig` and described below:

* **scan subtype**: either *Linear* (usual uniform 1D scan), *Back to start* (the actuator comes back to the initial position
  after each linear step, for a referenced measurement for instance), *Random* same as *Linear* except the
  predetermined positions are sampled randomly and from version 2.0.1 *Adaptive* that features no predetermined
  positions. These will be determined by an algorithm influenced by the signal returned from a detector on the
  previously sampled positions (see :ref:`adaptive_scans`)
* **Start**: Initial position of the selected actuator (in selected actuator controller unit)
* **Stop**: Last position of the scan (in selected actuator controller unit)
* **Step**: Step size of the step (in selected actuator controller unit)

For the special case of the Adaptive mode, one more feature is available: the *Loss type**. It modifies the algorithm
behaviour (see :ref:`adaptive_scans`)

Scan2D
++++++

The possible settings are visible on :numref:`scan2D_fig` and described below:

  .. _scan2D_fig:

.. figure:: /image/managers/scanner_widget.PNG
   :alt: scanner_fig

   The Scanner user interface set on a *Scan2D* scan type and a *Spiral* scan subtype and its particular settings.


* **Scan subtype**: See :numref:`scan2D_subtypes` either *linear* (scan line by line), *linear back and forth* (scan line by line
  but in reverse direction each 2 lines), *spiral* (start from the center and scan as a spiral), *Random* (random
  sampling of the *linear* case) and *Adaptive* (see :ref:`adaptive_scans`)
* **Start, Stop, Step**: for each axes (each actuators)
* **Rmax, Rstep, Npts/axis**: in case of spiral scan only. Rmax is the maximum radius of the spiral (calculated),
  and Npts/axis is the number of points for both axis (total number of points is therefore Npts/axisÂ²).
* **Selection**: see :ref:`scan_selector_paragraph`


  .. _scan2D_subtypes:

   The main Scan2D subtypes: Linear, Back and Forth and Spiral.




Sequential
++++++++++

The possible settings are visible on :numref:`scan_seq_fig` and described below:

* **Scan subtype**: only *linear* this means the scan have a sequence of Scan1D of the last specified actuator
  (on :numref:`scan_seq_fig`, it is *Xaxis*) for all positions of the last but end actuator (here *Yaxis*) and so on. So on
  :numref:`scan_seq_fig` there will be 11 steps for *Xaxis* times 11 steps for *Yaxis* times 10 steps for *Theta axis*
  so in total 11x11x10=1210 total steps for this 3 dimensions scan.

.. note::

  If only 1 actuator is selected, then the Sequential scan is identical to the *Scan1D* scan but where only the *linear*
  subtype is available. If 2 actuators are selected, then the Sequential scan is identical to the *Scan2D* scan but
  where only the *linear* subtype is available.

Tabular
+++++++

The tabular scan type consists of a list of positions (for each selected actuators).

Tabular Linear/Manual case
##########################
In the Linear/Manual case, the module will
move actuators on each positions and grab datas. On :numref:`scan_tabular_fig`, a list of 79 positions has been set.
By right clicking on the table, a context manager pops up and gives the possibility to:

* add one more position in the list
* remove the selected position
* clear all the positions
* load positions from a text file (as many columns as selected actuators with their positions separated by a tab)
* save the current list of positions in a text file (for later quick loading of positions)

One can also drag and drop elements of the list at a different index in the list.

   The Scanner user interface set on a *Tabular* scan type with a list of points for 2 actuators. A context menu with
   other options is also visible (right click on the table to show it)

Tabular Linear/Polylines case
#############################

In the particular case of 2 selected actuators, it could be more interesting to draw the positions for the tabular scan.
One possibility is to draw segments on a 2D viewer (see :numref:`scan_selector`) and positions will be points along
these segments (it will be a kind of 1D cuts within a 2D phase space). A new setting, *Curvilinear step*  appears. The
positions will be points starting from the start of the first segment and then step along them by the value of this setting.
That gives, for :numref:`scan_selector`, 40 points defined along the segments.

Tabular Adaptive case
#####################

**Valid for 1 or 2 selected actuators**. The tabular adaptive case will be similar to scan1D adaptive mode, except that one
adaptive Scan1D will be done for each segments defined by the list of positions in the table. For instance,
:numref:`scan_tabular_adaptive_fig` shows a list of 4 positions defining 4 segments in a 2D space. The adaptive scan will
be done on/along these 4 segments. Positions can be set manually or from a *Polylines* selection as seen on :numref:`scan_selector`.

.. _adaptive_scans:

Adaptive
++++++++


All the adaptive features are using the `python-adaptive`__ package (Parallel active learning of
mathematical functions, 10.5281/zenodo.1182437). And the reader is invited to explore their tutorials to discover how
these algorithms work. In PyMoDAQ the `learner1D`__ algorithm is used for the *Scan1D and Tabular* scan types while the
`learner2D`__ one is used for *Scan2D* scan type.

Bounds
######
As a general rule, the adaptive algorithm will need bounds to work with. For *Scan1D* scan type, these will be defined
from the *start* and *stop* settings. For *Tabular*, it is the start and ends of the segments. Finally for *Scan2D*, it
is the: *Start Ax 1*, *Stop Ax 1* and *Start Ax 2*, *Stop Ax 2* that are defining scan bounds.

Feedback
########

The adaptive algorithm will need for each probed positions a feedback value telling it the fitness of the probed points.
From these on all previous points, it will determine the best next points to probe. In order to provide such a feedback,
on has to choose a signal among all available from the DashBoard detectors. It has to be a Scalar so originate from a 0D
detector or integrated ROI from 1D or 2D detectors. The module manager user interface (right most setting tree in the
DAQ_Scan module ,see :numref:`module_managerfig`) will let you probe available datas exported from currently selected
detectors. You can then pick the Data0D one you want to use as the Adaptive feedback. For instance, on :numref:`module_managerfig`,
three Data0D are available, one from a 0D detector (CH000) and 2 from the Measurements ROIs of a 1D detector. In that case the
CH000 data has been selected and will therefore be use as feedback for the Adaptive algorithm.

Loss
####

All the Adaptive options are called *Loss* on the Scanner UI. These influence the adaptive algorithm, using previously
probed positions and their feedback to guess the next point to probe. See the `Adaptive documentation`__ on *loss*
to understand all the possibilities.
