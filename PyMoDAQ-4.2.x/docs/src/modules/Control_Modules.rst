Control Modules
===============

DAQ_Move and DAQ_Viewer can be used as stand alone user
interface to manually control hardware. DAQ_Viewer can be used like this to monitor and/or log data from a specific
detector. However, the main use is through the DashBoard module and its extensions (such as the :ref:`DAQ_Scan_module`
that will be used to perform automatic data acquisition)
