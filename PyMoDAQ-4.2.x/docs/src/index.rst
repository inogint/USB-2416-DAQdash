Welcome to PyMoDAQ's documentation!
===================================

PyMoDAQ is an open-source software, officially supported by the CNRS, to perform modular data acquisition with Python.
It proposes a set of modules used to interface any kind of experiments. It simplifies the interaction with detector and
actuator hardware to go straight to the data acquisition of interest.

   Training sessions announcement and PyMoDAQ's days

.. note::
   * Third edition of the PyMoDAQ's Days: Lyon 20/22 October 2024. Register on https://pymodaq-jt2022.sciencesconf.org/
   * Training session in Toulouse, France 17/19 June 2024

PyMoDAQ has two purposes:

* First, to provide a complete interface to perform automated measurements or logging data without having to write
  a user/interface for each new experiment.
* Second, to provide various tools (User interfaces, classes dedicated to specific tasks...) to easily build a :ref:`custom_app`

It is divided in two main components as shown on figure :numref:`overview_submodules`

* The :ref:`Dashboard_module` and its control modules: :ref:`DAQ_Move_module` and  :ref:`DAQ_Viewer_module`
* Extensions such as the :ref:`DAQ_Scan_module` or the :ref:`DAQ_Logger_module`

   PyMoDAQ's Dashboard and its extensions: DAQ_Scan for automated acquisitions, DAQ_Logger for data logging and many other.


The Control modules are interfacing real instruments using user written plugins. The complete list of available plugins
is maintained on this GitHub `repository`__ and installabled using the :ref:`PluginManager`
